The hurricane made landfall with estimated sustained winds of 125 mph, making it a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in this portion of Florida. Hurricane Idalia moved inland across the eastern Florida Big Bend and into South Central Georgia during the morning hours. Strong winds caused extensive damage to trees, buildings, and infrastructure along a broad swath stretching west to Tallahassee and east beyond the Suwannee River. Significant and devastating storm surge accompanied the hurricane into the Taylor and Dixie County coasts, where water levels rose considerably, inundating numerous structures along the coast and flooding residences and businesses many miles inland. Significant damage to property and infrastructure was associated with the storm surge that will take a considerable time to rebuild. The peak surge values observed were from Dekle Beach in Taylor County southeastward to Horseshoe Beach in Dixie County. Surge heights in this area along the immediate coast were within the range of 7 to 12 feet above normally dry ground. Lower values of up to 6 feet above normally dry ground were noted south of Horseshoe Beach near the community of Suwannee. It should also be noted the storm made landfall around the time of low tide. Had the storm made landfall 6 hours later, around the time of high tide, peak water level values could have been between 3-4 feet higher.  In the process of the high water mark surveys, interviews were conducted with several residents that lived in the area during the Storm of the Century, a non-tropical system that affected this portion of the Florida coastline on March 13, 1993.
